1) What is the difference between var, let, and const?
2) What is the difference between map(), forEach(), and filter()?
3) What are arrow functions in ES6?
4) How does destructuring assignment work in ES6?
5) Explain template literals in ES6. How are they different from string concatenation?



1) var can be used globally ,we can re-declare and re-assign it
   const and let are both are block variable means we can only use them in certain bracket or something like that........and we can nor re-declare their value
   let give us way to re-assign value but const not

2) forEach()------> we can loop elements of an array by using it
   map()----------> we use this function to re-organize or modify an array through looping.....
   filter()-------> this function create a new array from original one through looping/condition

3) arrow function is shorter and faster way to write any function.......arrow function have only one parameter

4) destructuring assignment is way to set default value or name for elements of array or object ........and set a value for functions parameter

5) template literals is improve and dynamic way to write strings using backticks instead of quotes.......we can write multiline strings in this backticks
